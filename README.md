## 🎯 What You Unlock
- 🔄 **One JAR, many loaders** — Balm runs on Forge, NeoForge *and* Fabric with identical code :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- 🧰 Common APIs (events, configs, networking) used by mods such as **Waystones**, **Cooking for Blockheads**, **Clumps**, **Curios**, **Jade**, and more :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- 📉 Smaller mod downloads & faster load-times thanks to shared libraries :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- 🧩 Built-in hooks for popular third-party mods (Curios/Trinkets, Jade, TheOneProbe) so everything “just works” together :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- 🛡 **Zero telemetry** — nothing leaves your machine; ideal for secure or air-gapped environments
